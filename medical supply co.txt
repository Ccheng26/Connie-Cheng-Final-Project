Wound Management
Insect Protection


Cleansing with regular tap water to remove all foreign materials. When possible, the wound should be washed with soap. Some wounds may need flushing with medical syringes, while others may need surgical debridement to remove foreign materials or dead tissue.

Treatment should also include proper wound care and dressing, and the application of local antibiotics where needed. These basic steps in wound treatment can help prevent wound infection and protect it from the environment. Some anti-inflammatory medicine and pain killers might also be prescribed to reduce discomfort and improve quality of life. If the last tetanus shot was given five or more years prior, it is recommended that a wound patient receive a new tetanus shot or a booster; especially in cases of human or animal bites, or dirty wounds.

Non-penetrating wounds: These are usually the result of blunt trauma or friction with other surfaces; the wound does not break through the skin, and may include:
Abrasions (scraping of the outer skin layer)
Lacerations (a tear-like wound)
Contusions (swollen bruises due to accumulation of blood and dead cells under skin)
Concussions (damage to the underlying organs and tissue on head with no significant external wound)

Penetrating wounds: These result from trauma that breaks through the full thickness of skin; reaching down to the underlying tissue and organs, and includes:
Stab wounds (trauma from sharp objects, such as knives)
Skin cuts
Surgical wounds (intentional cuts in the skin to perform surgical procedures)
Gunshot wounds (wounds resulting from firearms)

Miscellaneous wounds may include:
Thermal wounds: Extreme temperatures, either hot or cold, can result in thermal injuries (like burns, sunburns and frostbite)
Chemical wounds: These result from contact with or inhalation of chemical materials that cause skin or lung damage
Bites and Stings: Bites can be from humans, dogs, bats, rodents, snakes, scorpions, spiders and tick
Electrical wounds: These usually present with superficial burn-like or sting-like wounds secondary to the passage of high-voltage electrical currents through the body, and may include more severe internal damage.
